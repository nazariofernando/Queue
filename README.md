# Queue
Queue practice problem for compsci competitions taken from ITMOx: I2CPx (edx.org)

**Prompt:**

Implement a queue which supports push and pop operations. For every pop operation, output its result.

Input
The ﬁrst line of the input ﬁle contains a single integer number N ( 1 <= N <= 10^6 ) – the number of commands. N lines follow, each line contains exactly one command. There are the following commands:

+x: push x to the queue. Every x will be an integer such that |x|-<10^9 . The symbol + and the number will be separated by exactly one white space.

-: pop an element from the queue. It is guaranteed that this operation will never be executed on an empty queue. There will be at least one such operation.

Output:
Output the integers popped from the queue, one per line, in the order they were popped.
